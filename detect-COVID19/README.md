## Project Info

```
In this project, we are going to build a deep learning model that will detect, from the X-ray tests, of a person whether they are corona positive. This project aims to increase the accuracy of the detection of this virus using sophisticated deep learning.

## Data info

```
You need to combine your dataset from these two sources:

Corona positive X-Rays : https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
Normal X-Rays : https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
